Morris MultiPlayer FPS Game
=================

Ãœbergame is a free open source, realism like, multi-purpose,
multiplayer, casual, first-person-shooter game, based on the Torque3D MIT engine.




I plan to rework all the assets source files and properly release them on the internet,
but I'm behind the schedule and it is not complete yet.

For derivative art assets from GarageGames based demo assets that were open sourced I created
a repository where I upload my converted and updated versions of that:
https://github.com/Duion/Pacific-remastered //For Pacific demo assets and assets that use parts of it.
The Pacific assets are shipped with the game since version 1.0.8.0 and are actively used
since version 1.1.0.0.

Some assets source files may still be missing in any of those locations, so if you really really need
them just ask me, then I can send you a messy version.
